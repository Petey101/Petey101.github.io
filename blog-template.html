How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was fun working together and sharing design ideas with a pair. Creating the wireframe was not too difficult and it seems to serve as a good basis for future blog pages.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Wireframing seems useful to the development process because it gives you a sneak peek of what your site will look like. 

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
A good wireframe is simple and includes all the essential elements to your page.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I learned about the meta element and nav element from my partner. Meta element provides data about the HTML document. The nav element is used to represent a section of the page that links to other pages or parts within a page.
