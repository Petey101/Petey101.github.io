    <p>Yea, it sounds cheesy, but if you were to have me assign a title to myself, that would be it. I am of the mind that "To live, is to learn", and I believe that there is always someway to improve yourself. I love to learn and I love to learn about everything. This blog is mostly about my adventrures in Dev BootCamp(DBC) currently and hopefully it will eventually branch out to other topics in my life. 
    </p>

    <p> My number one goal right now is to be a great developer and create something that will change the world. A big dream, I know, but I believe having big dreams make the journey that much greater. The time I'm having in DBC is teaching me a world of new things and this step is going to be huge in reaching my goal. Technology is such an important part of our lives and I feel like there are many unexplored ways to make it even better. I'm hoping to learn even more once I finish DBC and expand my knowledge of how technology impacts society. My dream is to make something everyone in the world will know about! I want to make something great!

    <p>I grew up in NYC as a relatively shy boy. I wasn't sure what I wanted to do when I grew up. I had family members throwing me ideas and medicine stuck out a lot for me. The feeling of being able to help people really felt like me. I started on the path to medicine and as I got older, I realized it wasn't the thing for me. I wanted to help people still, but I don't think medicine let my creative side out. I went into business for a little while to sort of test the waters, but I don't think having the dollar be the deciding factor for many of the decisions I would have to make sit well with me. I finally learned about coding and realized that "This is it", this is how I can do something creative and at the same time affect people around the world.

    <p>Hobbies, I love mine. I get very analytical with my hobbies as well, much to my friends displeasure. I love to play video games, basketball, and nowadays, code. My favorite series of video games is probably Final Fantasy and it has been with me since I was growing up. I also love to play and watch basketball. I could use some work on my jumper, I think its getting rusty. Coding has been my main thing to do since I started DBC. I enjoying working through the challenges and finding multiple ways to reach the solutions. I hope to learn more about coding in the days to come!
