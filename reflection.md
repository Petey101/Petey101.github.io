What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that around each element is the padding, border, and margin in that order. These can all be manipulated to position and resize elements.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Positioning in CSS is a pain in the butt. The majority of my time was figuring out where to place things and how do it. I feel like there are some things that I don't know yet that could make this more simple.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
Positioning elements was easily the most difficult part. Color and text(when I decide what font to use) was the simplest part to implement. Color schemes took a while because I didn't understand them as much before I did some research.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
CSS is the sauce that brings the webpages to life. I had to research some elements and ways to move stuff around, but there's still a lot more out there. Classes are very important in specifying which elements you want to target.
