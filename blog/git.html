    #What are the benefits of version control?
    Version control is used by developers for many reasons, but I believe the biggest one is being able to keep track of their steps and progress. Version control allows you to retrace your steps and find a "good" copy of your work to return to if you should ever need it. Version control also allows others to work on the same project as you at the same time without interfering with one another.

       # How does git help you keep track of changes?
       Git helps you keep track of changes by saving your commits (checkpoints) with messages detailing your changes. This allows you to have a much simpler time if you were to retrace your steps.

        # Why use GitHub to store your code?
        Using GitHub to store your code allows you to use GitHub's services to share your code with others as well as use it a cloud like system to organize your work. GitHub also has tools you can use to collaborate with other people to work on a single project.
