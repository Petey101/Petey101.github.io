  <h1>My experience creating this blog</h1>
  <h4>2/7/2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>It's been quite a journey going through phase 0 at DBC. It's only been 9 weeks but I feel like I've learned an incredible amount. One of the earliest projects of phase 0 was the creation of this blog. It's been a work in progress for awhile and I do enjoy putting my thoughts to words every once in awhile. 
  
    </p>
    <p>The creation of this blog made me realize how difficult it can be to start a blog from nothing. The audience you are showing yourself to, the design and user aspects, and even the the simplest things like the colors you use all require a tremendous amount of thought. It's been very challenging for someone like me with no design experience to try to come up with a site that is appealing to the eyes and to what my audience is looking for.
       
    </p>
    <p>I've learned a lot in the creation of this site however. I learned HTML and CSS and learned how much flexibility there is and how different every site can be with just a few words. HTML and CSS is something that may have been easy to pick up, but will take an extensive amount of time to be able to master. I'm excited to see what new things I will learn to do to create a better blog.
