  <h1>Recursion</h1>
  <h2>How to understand Recursion if you don't know Recursion</h2>
  <h4>1/31/2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>To understand recursion, we will first have to define what recursion is. Recursion occurs when a process or procedure calls upon itself. When this occurs, the process or procedure is said to be recursive. When it comes to programming languages like Ruby, a recursive method calls upon itself and repeats until a end case is defined. If a end case is not defined, the method will repeat infintely and cause issues. 
  
    </p>
    <p><script src="https://gist.github.com/Petey101/5216beb599cac77c3af2.js"></script> With a very simple recursive method, you can count down to 0 with any integer put into the countdown method. The "return if" line exists as a base case to halt the recursion so an infinite loop does not occur. The method will then continue to put down the value of x and then run itself again subtracting 1 from x until x is equal to 0. This is an example of single recursion, where a function calls upon itself. Single recursion is very similar to iteration and is more a matter of space and computation time. There are multiple types of recursion relating to the where the function is called and by how many functions that call it. 
       
    </p>
    <p>Recursion can be used to target specific ranges in large databases and execute a procedure with less coding. Most of the time in coding, recursion is used to make code simpler to read(assuming you understand what recursion is) and to simplify repetitive code.
