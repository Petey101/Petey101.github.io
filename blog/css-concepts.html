  <h2>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. IDs?</h2>
  <h4>12/19/2015</h4>

    <p>
    Before we discuss the best practices with classes and ids, its probably best to describe what they are.
    Let's start with ids first because they are more specific. IDs are unique and each element can only have one ID and each ID can only be used on that element.
    Classes are slightly more broad and you can use the same classes on multiple elements and an element can have multiple classes on it as well.
  
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have a general idea of what classes and ids are, we can talk about the best practices when it comes to using them. Since we know that IDs are more specific we want to be very selective when it comes to using them. We will use IDs for very specific examples like if you wanted an element to look different from every other element on the page. Remember that IDs are unique.
      Classes are used more generally for things such as font type for a couple of paragraphs or making a group of pictures have a different colored background. You will be using classes for a group of elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using classes and IDs are very important when it comes to CSS!
      Make sure to get plenty of practice with them!
